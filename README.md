# ACETheBrainAPI
API for concussion detection AI system powered by passive texting to help athletes and atheltic trainers to diagnose concussions.

Frontend Mobile App found at: https://github.com/anthonyemberley/ACETheBrainApp

#Features
This API is built to store and train the model for an anomoly detection algorithm.  Each time a new text message is sent on the app, it is sent to this API, stored and compared to the model for that user's texting behaviors to see if it is enough of an outlier to alert atheltic trainers the athlete may have a concussion.
